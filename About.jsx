        <p>
        Hello! My name is Rappah-Elzion F. Bauyon, and I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at Cavite State University Bacoor. I have always been passionate about technology and problem-solving, which inspired me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong interest in software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

As a student, I enjoy learning how to design and build efficient, user-friendly applications. I also like exploring how data can be used to make better decisions and how intelligent systems can improve everyday life. My goal is to become a skilled software engineer who contributes to meaningful projects and continues to learn new technologies.

I have gained experience working with several programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB. In addition, I use tools such as GitHub and Visual Studio Code to support my projects and learning.

Some of the projects I’ve worked on include building a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects have helped me strengthen my technical skills and apply classroom concepts to real-world situations.

Outside of academics, I’m always eager to explore new technologies, participate in coding challenges, and collaborate on innovative ideas. I believe that continuous learning and curiosity are key to growth in the tech field.
